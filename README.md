# Modern XPosed API Demo

Modern XPosed API Demo app based on libxposed-api library from LSPosed Team. This has been developed using the below resources & libraries.

Develop XPosed Modules using Modern Xposed API wiki : https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/wiki/Develop-Xposed-Modules-Using-Modern-Xposed-API

Libxposed  API: https://github.com/libxposed/api
Libxposed API example : https://github.com/libxposed/example


Libxposed example is in Kotlin, so I wrote this in Java so that developer can use for their reference.

As the libraries JARs are not availble in Mavne repository as of now, I have included them in libs folder so that anyone can directly use them. I built API AAR file using GitHub Action and the Helper AAR file manually on my local system.

Enjoy developing cool Xposed modules.
